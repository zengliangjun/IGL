# HumanoidVerse2 : A Multi-Simulator Framework with Modular Design for Humanoid Robot Sim-to-Real Learning.

Developed based on [HumanoidVerse ](README_HumanoidVerse.md), please refer to [HumanoidVerse ](README_HumanoidVerse.md) for environment settings and initial operation.
Aiming to improve the efficiency of robot algorithm development.

# TASK
Extract the task into different submodules, with all submodules having a lifecycle similar to [BaseManager](humanoidverse/envs/base_task/term/base.py)

## BaseManager

<details>
<summary>BaseManager</summary>
```python

class BaseManager():

    def __init__(self, _task):
        # task/env object（Sub class of BaseTask）
        self.task = _task

        # number of environments
        self.num_envs = _task.num_envs

        # device of the task/env  runing on
        self.device = _task.device

        self.config = _task.config

    # The first phase, initialization phase
    def pre_init(self):
        pass

    def init(self):
        pass

    def post_init(self):
        pass

    # Phase 2, simulation environment operation phase
    def pre_physics_step(self, actions):
        pass

    def physics_step(self):
        pass

    def post_physics_step(self):
        pass

    # The third stage, the computation phase
    def pre_compute(self):
        pass

    def check_termination(self):
    	'''
        At present, it is only implemented by the episode module for calculating whether the environment terminates
        '''
        pass

    def compute_reward(self):
    	'''
        Currently only implemented by the rewards module for calculating rewards
        '''
        pass

    def reset(self, env_ids):
    	'''
        Used to reset the termination environment
        '''
        pass

    def compute(self):
    	'''
        The related operations of the submodule during the computation phase are implemented here.
        '''
        pass

    def post_compute(self):
        pass

    #The fourth stage is the debug phase
    def draw_debug_vis(self):
        pass
'''

<summary>Stages of the lifecycle</summary>

- init: initialization phase
- physics_step:  simulation environment step phase

<summary>dependency situations</summary>

- pre: other submodel depend the submodel
-  no depend(depended)

<summary>Special interface</summary>

- check_termination: only implemented by the episode module, used to calculate whether the environment terminates

## register

All submodules are registered, created by [BaseTask](humanoidverse/envs/base_task/base_task.py)

# AGENT
Extract sub modules from the agent, and the lifecycle of all sub modules is as follows[BaseComponent](humanoidverse/agents/base_algo/base.py)
